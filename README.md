# Unity Publisher Client

WIP

A web server and frontend that makes use of [Unity Publisher API](https://github.com/Kwintenvdb/unity-publisher-api) to fetch and visualize data from Unity's Asset Store Publisher management.

## Roadmap

* Fetch and visualize sales data
   * Sales data by month
   * Overall sales data
   * Display with graphs and tables
* Set up email notifications for new sales
   * New sales for all packages or per-package
